## 📖 About the Project  
**Faumation** is a project utilizing **Internet of Things (IoT)** technology to develop a **Water Level Monitoring System** and **Water Heater Automation** for residential water storage. The system is powered by an **Arduino Uno R3 V2.0** module and includes:  
- **Automatic faucet control** based on water levels:  
  - When the water level reaches **90%**, the faucet automatically turns off.  
  - When the water level drops to **10%**, the faucet turns on again.  
  - Users can manually control the faucet when water levels are between **11%-89%**.  
- **Water temperature control**:  
  - If the water temperature is below **20°C**, the heater turns on.  
  - If the water temperature exceeds **40°C**, the heater turns off.  
  - Users can manually control the heater when the water temperature is between **21°C-39°C**.  

**Faumation** is available as a simulation on **Proteus** and also accessible via a **Web Application** through your browser.
